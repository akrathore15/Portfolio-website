                </p>
                <p>
                    I have good knowledge of various technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I like to be known as Web Developer and want to achieve great heights in my life as a developer. I am always hungry for the knowledge.
                </p>

                    Along with the knowledge of Web Development, I am really interested in learning new skills either technical or non-technical.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Actually, I am a sporty girl, I have eager to play every sport specially throwball. In my school days, I played throwball at state-level, and recently I have learnt a new sport called table-tennis which I never played before and that was such an amazing experience to play.

                    When pitching a design to a client, presentation is always crucial. Showing a clean and polished design at any stage of the design process is a given, but there are other ways to help your design outshine the competition. Utilizing mocks-ups is a powerful way to convince your clients that your design fits their brand, and it is something that most professional designers do.

                    When you introduce your animal partner to a reader in a library or school, a patient in a hospital, or a nursing home, you are expressing an act of unselfish caring that few others do. By sharing a trading card like the ones shown here you can take that selfless act one step further. You can leave them with a lasting memory of the love and comfort. In some cases, it can be almost as priceless as the visit itself.

                    When you submit an application — whether it’s for a job or a client project — you probably know that there are hundreds, maybe even thousands of applicants who want the job as much as you do. So, what do you need to stand out from the crowd? You need an outstanding portfolio.A web developer portfolio isn’t just a collection of work samples. Instead, it’s an opportunity for you to showcase skills.
